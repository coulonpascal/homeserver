Introduction
============

.. include:: includes/all.rst

This role installs a ownCloud_ instance on a specified host, either with
SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL database as a backend and an nginx
webserver as a frontend.

ownCloud will be installed as package coming directly from upstream.

Note that Nginx is `not officially supported by ownCloud nor NextCloud <https://github.com/debops/ansible-owncloud/issues/49>`_ but it is community supported and should work without problems. Apache is supported by the role but not yet used by default.
